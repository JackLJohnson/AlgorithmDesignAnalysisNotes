\chapter{Graph Algorithms}
\textbf{Graphs represent pairwise relationships amongst a set of objects}. The objects are called vertices or nodes. The relationships are called edges or arcs, each connecting a pair of vertices. An edge can be directed or undirected. The set of vertices and the set of edges are noted respectively as $V$ and $E$. Graph is a concept heavily used in reality. Road networks, the web, social networks, precedence constraints are all examples of graphs.

A connected graph composed of $n$ vertices with no parallel edges has at least $n-1$ and at most $n(n-1)/2$ edges. Let $m$ represent the number of edges. In most applications, $m$ is $\Omega(n)$ and $O(n^2)$. If $m$ is $O(n)$ or close to it, the graph is called a sparse graph, while if $m$ is closer to $O(n^2)$, it's called a dense graph. Yet their delimitation is not strictly clear. 
\section{Representation}
\subsection{Adjacent Matrix}
An undirected graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and no parallel edges can be represented by an $n\times n$ 0-1 matrix $A$. $A_{ij}=1$ when and only when $G$ has an $i-j$ edge. Variants of this representation can easily accommodate parallel edges, weighted edges: just let $A_{ij}$ represent the number of parallel edges or the weight of the edge. For directed graphs, $i\rightarrow j$ can be represented by $A_{ij}=1$ and $A_{ji}=-1$.

Adjacent matrix representation requires $\Theta(n^2)$ space. For a dense graph this is fine, but for a sparse graph it is wasteful. 
\subsection{Adjacent Lists}
The adjacent lists representation is composed of 4 ingredients:
\begin{itemize}
\item Array/List of vertices. $\Theta(n)$ space.
\item Array/List of edges. $\Theta(m)$ space.
\item Each edge points to its end points. $\Theta(m)$ space.
\item Each vertex points to edges incident on it. $\Theta(m)$ space.
\end{itemize}
Adjacent lists representation requires $\Theta(n+m)$ space. 

The choice between the two representations depends on the density of the graph and operations to take. We will mainly use adjacent lists in this chapter.
\section{Minimum Cut}
\subsection{Definition}
\begin{definition}
A cut of a graph ($V,E$) is a partition of $V$ into two non-empty sets $A$ and $B$.
\end{definition}
A graph with $n$ vertices has $2^n-2$ possible cuts. 
\begin{definition}
The crossing edges of a cut($A,B$) are those with 
\begin{itemize}
\item one endpoint in $A$ and the other in $B$, for undirected graphs;
\item tail in $A$ and head in $B$, for directed graphs.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
We will try to solve the minimum cut problem:
\begin{description}
\item[Input]An undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ in which parallel edges are allowed.
\item[Output]A cut $(A,B)$ with minimum number of crossing edges.
\end{description}
A lot of problems in reality can be reduced to a minimum cut problems:
\begin{itemize}
\item Identify weakness point of physical networks;
\item Community detection in social networks;
\item Image segmentation.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Random Contraction Algorithm}
\begin{algorithm}[ht]
\caption{Random Contraction}\label{randomcontraction}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Input\Statex{An undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ in which parallel edges are allowed.}
\Output\Statex{A cut $(A,B)$ with minimum number of crossing edges}
\While{There are more than 2 vertices left}
\State{Pick a remaining edge $(u,v)$ randomly}
\State{Merge(or contract) $u,v$ into a single vertex}
\State{Remove self-loops}
\EndWhile
\State{Return cut represented by 2 final vertices}
\end{algorithmic}
